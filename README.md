## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I encountered some issues with the CSS classes, for example .container, or .card-main. They were working fine form local host, but not showing at all in the Github live page. 

I've used Chat GPT for a solution and it looks like these classes were conflictig with some defaults, and after renaming them, everthing worked just fine.



### Continued development

I will continue with the Frontend Mentor in my transition from designer to dev.
